<h2>
  Bilingual Personality Disorder

  <p>
    This may be the first time you hear about this made-up disorder but it
    <suggestion id="suggestion-1:user-2" suggestion-type="insertion" type="start"></suggestion>actually<suggestion id="suggestion-1:user-2" suggestion-type="insertion" type="end"></suggestion>
    isn’t so far from the truth. Even the studies that were conducted almost half a century show
    that <strong>the language you speak has more effects on you than you realize</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the very first experiments conducted on this topic dates back to 1964.
    <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9440038_Language_and_TAT_content_in_bilinguals">In the experiment</a>
    designed by linguist Ervin-Tripp who is an

    in psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic studies, adults who are bilingual
    in English in French were showed series of pictures and were asked to create 3-minute stories.
    In the end participants emphasized
    drastically different dynamics for stories in English and French.

    Another ground-breaking experiment which included bilingual Japanese women married to American men
    <suggestion id="suggestion-4:user-1" suggestion-type="deletion" type="start"></suggestion>in San
    Francisco <suggestion id="suggestion-4:user-1" suggestion-type="deletion" type="end">
    </suggestion>were
    asked to complete sentences. The goal of the experiment was to investigate whether or not human
    feelings and thoughts
    are expressed differently in <strong>different language mindsets</strong>.

    Here is a sample from the the experiment:

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>English</th>
        <th>Japanese</th>

    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Real friends should</td>
        <td>Be very frank</td>
        <td>Help each other</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>I will <suggestion id="suggestion-5:user-2" suggestion-type="formatInline:886cqig6g8rf" type="start"></suggestion>probably<suggestion id="suggestion-5:user-2" suggestion-type="formatInline:886cqig6g8rf" type="end"></suggestion> become</td>
        <td>A teacher</td>
        <td>A housewife</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>When there is a conflict with family</td>
        <td>I do what I want</td>
        <td>It's a time of great unhappiness</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>
    More recent <a href="https://books.google.pl/books?id=1LMhWGHGkRUC">studies</a> show, the
    language a person speaks affects
    their cognition, behavior, emotions and hence <strong>their personality</strong>.
    This shouldn’t come as a surprise
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function">since we already know</a>
    that different regions of the brain become more active depending on the person’s activity at hand.
    The structure, information and especially <strong>the culture</strong> of languages varies
    substantially and the language a person speaks is an essential element of daily life.
